# Teeth
<!-- Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_tooth -->
Human teeth function to mechanically break down items of food by cutting and crushing them in preparation for swallowing and digesting. As such, they are considered part of the human digestive system. Humans have four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each have a specific function.
