# Testosterone
<!-- Taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone -->
Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid in males. In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. It is associated with increased aggression, violence, and criminal behavior, sex drive, the inclination to impress partners and other courting behaviors.
